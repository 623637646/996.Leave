There are many things you cannot change, but you can choose to leave.

996.icu

background
A great engineer, 996icu, initiated the 996.ICU (some browsers have been blocked, mighty) project and accused the country of overtime chaos. In just a few days, it has exceeded 17w stars.

Pay tribute to him, pay tribute to all engineers.

Why write this article
I used to work in a large factory in China, and I had a job that seemed enviable (really enviable). But for various reasons, I left China and came to Singapore. I discovered that life can be so different. So I write this article to express my feelings, and I hope it can help some people.

about me
Yanni, Wang Ar

Joined Shopee (Singapore) in August 2018 as an iOS development engineer.

Born in 1990, graduated from a domestic university in 13 years, and worked in iOS for 7 years.

Work intensity
Basically work 8 hours a day, and rarely work overtime (unlike in China, even if the work is done, I am embarrassed or the leader is not allowed to leave work)

Tell a joke:

Domestic: I evaluated it in 1 month. The leader said that we need 20 days for this. The boss said that we only have 15 days and the project must be launched. (This is a bit subjective, but it does happen often)

Singapore: I finished the evaluation in one month, and my colleagues helped analyze and evaluate, "Did you consider XXX, I think you need more time"

salary
All here are average

Annual salary: major domestic factory + stocks + year-end bonus >= Singapore Internet company >= major domestic factory + year-end bonus

Monthly Salary: Most Singapore companies have fewer year-end bonuses (0-2 months, or 3 months), so the monthly salary is much higher than that of domestic manufacturers.

Hourly rate: Singapore wins.

Tax, pension, medical and other
Domestic: 25%-40% total

Individual tax 3%-18%
Pension insurance 8%
Medical insurance 2%
Housing Provident Fund 12%
Singapore: 1.37%-8.72% in total

Tax
Chinese tax

Tax calculator

Annual income of RMB 20w, tax rate 3%
Annual income of RMB 40w, tax rate 8%
Annual income of 60w RMB, tax rate 14%
Annual income of RMB 80w, tax rate of 18%
Singapore Personal Tax Official Data

Annual income of RMB 20w, tax rate of 1.37%
Annual income of RMB 40w, tax rate of 4.19%
Annual income of 60w RMB, tax rate 6.6%
Annual income of RMB 80w, tax rate 8.72%
It is paid once a year, there is no need to pay at ordinary times, and there are no other mandatory taxes (for foreigners).

Individual taxes in Singapore are much lower than in China (it really is a tax haven).

Pension
Come, tell a joke (it seems to be the title of XX Daily?)

1985: Only one is good, the government comes to provide for the aged
1995: Only one is good, the government helps the elderly
2005: The old age cannot rely on the government
2012: Postpone retirement, take care of yourself
I don’t need the government to provide for the pension.

Singapore's elderly care is not good either, and many elderly people are also working. But what I appreciate is that Singapore’s pension policy is more open and transparent. It is better to say that you do not provide for the idlers than the old. When you are young, you can buy endowment insurance by yourself or save money for financial management. Old age is not a problem.

medical insurance
I'm sorry, I see a doctor in China, and I can buy cheap medicine with RMB, but I have to buy expensive medicine if I use medical insurance. I don't want to pay this insurance anymore.

Singapore also has a problem with this. If you don't buy medical insurance (the medical insurance is voluntarily bought), it will be expensive to see a doctor. Everyone, Google.

housing fund
Among the five social insurances and one housing fund, this is probably the most useful item? No, no, you pay 10,000, and the company pays 10,000. It seems that you are taking advantage of it, but there is an immutable truth: the wool comes from the sheep .

At the same time, I am not optimistic about China's housing market (as far as I know, housing provident fund is getting harder and harder to withdraw).

Singapore also has a housing provident fund, but it is mandatory for citizens and PR (permanent residents), and foreigners do not need to pay. Specifically, you can Google.

Vacation
For 7 to 9 days in China, let’s talk about it. Many people’s annual leave is overdue and wasted due to unapproved leaders and too busy work.

Singapore has 18 days of annual leave a year, plus 14 days of statutory holidays, and various other holidays (personal leave, sick leave, hospital leave, etc.). I forgot what it was, anyway. Basically, I have never encountered anyone who does not grant annual leave.

consumption
Renting, 2500-10000 RMB per month, single room. Generally speaking, it is a bit more expensive.
For meals, 30-80 RMB for a regular meal. The restaurant will be very expensive, basically 150-350 RMB per person.
Daily necessities, except for electrical appliances, cigarettes and alcohol, are more expensive, but everything else is fine.
Transportation, commuting to get off work a day, subway 10-20 yuan, depending on the specific situation.
House price
It is relatively expensive for foreigners to buy a house, but it is not as expensive as Beishangshen (a bit more expensive than second-tier cities, depending on the location). If you can apply for a PR (permanent resident) or become a citizen (renounce Chinese nationality), buying a house will be very cheap (equivalent to a third-tier city in China). Specific information Google can help you.

inflation
I don’t have a specific inflation rate in China. If I don’t believe the government’s announcement, I know that money is becoming less and less valuable.

Singapore inflation rate 3-5%

About layoffs
The recent violent layoffs by NetEase have caused a turmoil with Huawei 251 .

I personally feel that with the disappearance of the demographic dividend and the slowdown of economic development, such large-scale layoffs of enterprises are inevitable. This year is the worst year in ten years, and perhaps the best year in the next ten years.

It is understandable that the business cycle determines the layoffs of enterprises, but violent layoffs are strongly opposed, and layoffs should be compensated in accordance with the Labor Law. I hope that companies will not be too ugly, and that Chinese laws can be an umbrella for the weak, rather than a stepping stone for the strong.

On the contrary, Singapore is a country with a real rule of law, and I can't guarantee that companies will not lay off employees. However, it is affirmative to safeguard one's own legitimate rights and interests through legal channels.

Language
Singaporean English is the main language, but Chinese and most Singaporeans can communicate in Chinese.

Many companies in Singapore do not require high English. For people who want to come to Singapore, English is really not the most important thing! Persist in taking the first step.

My company interviews in Chinese throughout the whole process.

Take me as an example:

I got a score of 150 in English for the college entrance examination. I haven’t passed the CET 4 exam 4 times (and it’s the one with a big gap =. =)

After coming to Singapore, I am also working hard to learn English (studying on the subway and studying at night, I finally know that English is the most important subject in elementary, middle, and high schools=.=). I feel a lot better. Thank you for your help from my friends here (many of my closest colleagues are Chinese).

Interview
Interviews for companies in Singapore are relatively difficult.

mainly reflects in:

The basic interview is very meticulous, and it is difficult to get through if the basic skills are not good.
Algorithm interviews are very common, especially if you need to type code on a certain platform on the Internet, Run results (it seems not many in China)
After the interview is passed, the company will help apply for a work visa. Just wait for the notice and buy a ticket to come to work.

Express one's own opinion
yanjunding :

I have worked in Singapore for 10+ years and have just arrived in New Zealand recently. There are many ITers here from Singapore. But there are also many who want to return to Singapore. Singapore’s low taxes and many Chinese faces are the main reasons. Singapore's education method is similar to that in China. It is high-intensity and is basically covered by tutoring on weekends. New Zealand is more stocking and the work is simpler.
All Singaporean citizens and second-generation PRs need to serve, and basically cannot escape. If you run away, you will never have a chance to work in Singapore.

Overtime and competition in Singapore are also very fierce, add a few missing points
Consultation from an engineer who got the Shopee offer:

I read your 996.Leave article, and with the idea of going abroad, I voted for Shopee and got an offer. However, after looking at the evaluation of Shopee on Glassdoor, I found a lot of bad reviews, such as:

Cannot take leave more than 1 week
Work in the office until 2am for two days and be in the office by 9:50am every month during campaign
Led by a bunch of inexperienced managers
Get tech requirements from newly joined PMs who know the products no better than you
Controlled by HRs in every aspects of your life
Such comments made me quite hesitant. I would like to ask you about the actual situation and whether I would recommend the freshman to go there. Hope to get your reply.

And my reply:

Regarding these comments you made, there are some inconsistencies and some justifications. Let me talk about them one by one.

Cannot take leave more than 1 week I haven't encountered this thing. I have never heard that the leave is not approved for one week. Many people ask for leave for one or two weeks. This is normal. I have only encountered those who asked for leave for 2 consecutive months without approval.
Work in the office until 2am for two days and be in the office by 9:50am every month during campaign. During the big promotion period, it is indeed necessary for many people to work late or go to the company early. Just like Ali’s Double Eleven, this is a very important day of the year. I think that under normal circumstances, my work and life balance is pretty good.
Led by a bunch of inexperienced managers This personal subjective impression is too strong, any company has good leaders and inexperienced leaders.
Get tech requirements from newly joined PMs who know the products no better than you Indeed some PMs are not very experienced. But it does not mean that the whole company is like this.
Controlled by HRs in every aspects of your life HR has never controlled my life. I have never heard of whose life HR is controlling.
I recommend freshmen, because the company's prospects are good and the platform is also very good. The curriculum vitae of the corresponding graduates has been greatly improved. I am a non-stakeholder, so I do not praise Shopee or Black Shopee.
